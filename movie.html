            <p class="subtitle">
                A psychotic general sets humanity on a dangerous path, 
                and the world scrambles to prevent total nuclear annihilation.
            </p>
            <p id="synopsis-text">
                U.S. Air Force General Jack Ripper goes completely and utterly mad, 
                and sends his bomber wing to destroy the U.S.S.R. He suspects that 
                the communists are conspiring to pollute the "precious bodily fluids" 
                of the American people. The U.S. president meets with his advisors, 
                where the Soviet ambassador tells him that if the U.S.S.R. is hit by 
                nuclear weapons, it will trigger a "Doomsday Machine" which will destroy 
                all plant and animal life on Earth. Peter Sellers portrays the three men 
                who might avert this tragedy: British Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the 
                only person with access to the demented Gen. Ripper; U.S. President 
                Merkin Muffley, whose best attempts to divert disaster depend on placating 
                a drunken Soviet Premier and the former Nazi genius Dr. Strangelove, who 
                concludes that "such a device would not be a practical deterrent for reasons 
                which at this moment must be all too obvious". Will the bombers be stopped
                in time, or will General Jack Ripper succeed in destroying the world?

                <p class=review-text>Seen after 30 years, "Dr. Strangelove" seems remarkably fresh and undated - a clear-eyed, irreverant, dangerous satire. And its willingness to follow the situation to its logical conclusion - nuclear annihilation - has a purity that today's lily-livered happy-ending technicians would probably find a way around. Its black and white photography helps, too, putting an unadorned face on its deadly political paradoxes. If movies of this irreverence, intelligence and savagery were still being made, the world would seem a younger place.</p>

                <p class=review-text>Like most of his work, Stanley Kubrick's deadly black satirical comedy-thriller on cold war madness and its possible effects (1964) has aged well: the manic, cartoonish performances of George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, and Peter Sellers (in three separate roles, including the title part) look as brilliant as ever, and Kubrick's icy contempt for 20th-century humanity may find its purest expression in the figure of Strangelove himself, a savage extrapolation of a then-obscure Henry Kissinger conflated with Wernher von Braun and Dr. Mabuse to suggest a flawed, spastic machine with Nazi reflexes that ultimately turns on itself. With Peter Bull, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens, and James Earl Jones.</p>

                <p class=review-text>By a whopping margin, this is Kubrick's most radical film and greatest dramatic gamble. It was the director's idea, after steeping himself in game theory and end-of-the-world scenarios, to go for vicious comedy.</p>

            <div class="review">
                <p class=review-text>Because of its uncanny insight and frighteningly prescient satirical edge, Dr. Strangelove is a document of its time and also timeless. It held onto its relevancy by being bitter, cynical, and thinking absolutely the worst of people.</p>
